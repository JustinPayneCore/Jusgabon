# Jusgabon - 2D Zelda-like game

Made by:

- Gabriel Baluyut
- Jason Cheung
- Justin Payne

Created in ``C#`` with the use of the ``MonoGame`` framework.



# About the game

Jusgabon is a top-down, 2D Legend of Zelda like game, that we modeled after a tutorial we found on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw). The tutorial shows the game being made, but with ``Python`` instead of ``C#``.  We wanted to create the game with our new found knowledge of the .NET framework.

### Game mechanics

- Movement
- Combat with mobs and bosses
- Dashing with the ``SPACE`` bar 
- Abilities such as spell casting and weapons
- Menus and UI for health, mana, and stamina


# Future items to implement

- Sounds
- Storyline
- More levels
- Shop
